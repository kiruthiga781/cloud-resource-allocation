- Round Robin
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Priority Scheduling
- Best Fit Allocation

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Generates random tasks and virtual machines (VMs)
- Calculates metrics like turnaround time and waiting time
- Compares the performance of various allocation algorithms
- Saves results in the /results folder

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## â–¶ How to Run
```bash
python main.py
